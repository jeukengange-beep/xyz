# Presentation Improvement Recommendations

## 1. Clarify Narrative Flow
- Add an agenda slide after the cover to orient the audience and signpost the "Market research → Segmentation → Positioning → Roadmap" storyline. Use Reveal.js's [fragments](https://revealjs.com/fragments/) sparingly so each agenda item appears as you enter the section.
- Insert short transition slides (e.g., "From insight to personas") to reinforce the narrative jump between research, personas, and messaging. Tie each transition back to the North Star metrics already highlighted in the deck (Retention, On-time, CAC). 
- Integrate the deliverable prompts from the brief (market research methods, win-loss, competitor insights) into the relevant slides instead of keeping them implicit. For example, dedicate a slide that summarises the two primary and two secondary research methods with takeaways.

## 2. Strengthen Evidence & Data Visuals
- Replace placeholder KPI values in the "North Star" slides with the latest quantitative data, and show the delta directly on-slide (e.g., "Retention 30d: 58% → 64% after weekly plan"). Add `data-auto-animate` to highlight improvements between cohorts by animating the numbers.
- For "Adoption & Cohorts", label axes, specify the time period, and highlight key inflection points via annotations. Consider using stacked bars to compare plan mix evolution (Daily vs Weekly vs Corporate) if more than two plans exist.
- Add a slide for "Win/Loss insights" that couples a short quote with a metric (e.g., churn reason distribution). Use the existing `.card` layout to keep visual consistency.

## 3. Deepen Segmentation & Persona Detail
- Expand each segmentation type with one quant signal (e.g., % of user base) and one behavioral nugget. You can reuse the `.grid-3` layout but add icons for quick scanning.
- For personas, replace the photo placeholders with actual images or stylized illustrations, and enrich the bullet list with "Key triggers" and "Top objections". Use Reveal fragments so these appear as you tell the story.
- Follow personas with a customer journey mini-map slide that visualises Awareness → Consideration → Subscription → Retention, using the `.grid-2` structure with timeline elements.

## 4. Sharpen Positioning & Messaging
- Convert the positioning statement into a formatted template slide (Problem → Solution → Proof). Add a supporting slide that lists feature pillars and ties them back to the personas (e.g., "Student Plan → Nora"), potentially using the `.grid-3` layout for symmetry.
- Evolve the messaging table by adding channels and proof points (e.g., "Channel: WhatsApp broadcast", "Proof: 92% on-time deliveries"). Reveal.js supports table row fragments; apply `class="fragment"` per row so messages land sequentially.

## 5. Enhance Visual Polish & Consistency
- Harmonise background colors by grouping slides into thematic blocks (Research, Segmentation, Messaging) with distinct `data-background-color` values, and use the `.bg-blue::before` gradient sparingly to avoid visual fatigue.
- Replace `[PLACEHOLDER]` blocks (competitor screenshots, headshots, sources) with final assets. Embed real screenshots using `<img>` tags inside the `.card` containers to leverage existing styles.
- Add subtle section intro graphics by leveraging the `data-mini` system already in the deck—map reactions to slide mood (e.g., `data-mini="idea_eureka"` for research insights, `data-mini="money_eyes"` for metrics).

## 6. Increase Interactivity & Delivery Support
- Turn on the Reveal.js speaker notes plugin (already imported) by writing presenter notes inside `<aside class="notes">…</aside>` blocks, summarising the key talk track per slide.
- Use the built-in progress bar (`progress:true`) but also enable the toolbar (`controlsTutorial:true`) to help new viewers navigate when sharing asynchronously.
- Consider embedding quick polls or decision prompts using Reveal.js' `data-auto-animate` and fragments—for instance, show a question slide, then reveal the answer with the supporting data.

## 7. Close with Impact & Next Steps
- Expand the "Next Steps" slide into a mini roadmap with owners and timeframes. Turn each bullet into a KPI card to reinforce accountability.
- Add a final "Ask" slide (e.g., resources needed, support required) so stakeholders know how to help.
- Provide a final "Appendix" section (hidden using `data-visibility="hidden"` or placed after the thank-you slide) with detailed research tables, methodology, and backups for questions.

## Reveal.js Implementation Tips
- Take advantage of global styles defined in `index.html` (e.g., `.card`, `.grid-2`, `.grid-3`, `.mini`) to maintain consistent spacing and typography.
- When adding new media, host assets alongside the deck or in a CDN with fast load times to prevent lag in live presentations.
- Test the deck with `?print-pdf` parameter to ensure exported handouts retain layout; adjust CSS if elements overflow the printable area.
